**Progress Logs 

12NOV: Figured out how to properly utilize the GitHub for Scrython API. 
    -Able to access more card features. Read the 'docs' folder.
    -Newest hassle is tackling tkinter and setting up the interface to show cards.

Fixes in the classroom:

-Will search commander legal cards that are legendary creatures for the commander.
-Automatically declares commander if only one in the list.
-Will pull up a random card to see if it can fit in the deck or not.

Home progress:
IDEA: Random Commander deck generator. Not found in a quick search. 
Goal is to spin up a deck that is playable. Not good.
-Milestone: add method with add cards with given color identity
-Random creature base is generated. However, very slowly. Need to work on how to optimize searching.
